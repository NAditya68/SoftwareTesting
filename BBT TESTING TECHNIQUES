TECHNIQUES USED FOR BLACK BOX TESTING  

BLACKBOX TESTING- It is a testing process in which the tester who performs the testing is not aware of the coding or internal structure.

Diffrent techniques used are

1)BOUNDARY VALUE ANALYSIS-In this method the boundary values of a system are targetted.For example lets us say  a field accepts a value from 1-10.Then we give values 0,1,2, and 9,10,11 to check the behaviour.
This technique is mainly done to check the behaviour of a system at its boundary.

2)EQUIVALNCE PARTITON TESTING:In this method ,the various input are divieded into catrgories to valid and invalid values and its mandatory that all the catorgies must shoe imilar behaviour.

3)DECISION TABLE TECHNIQUE:It is a technique where a system is tested for various combinations and their respective output is captured in a tabluar format.
For Example:consider we need to uplaod any image in we bsite.it will ask for lets say a jpeg format and max size as 100kb.

4)State Transition Technique:This is technique where we test the the change in state of a software process.For example ATM pin enetered correctly once ,twice and incorreclty once twice and thrice (it must blocked).
This technique is applied speciialy to those systems who provied a specific number of attempts to access them.

5)ERROR GUESING TECHNIQUE:Its doesent invovle any particular method to guess the error.Its a technique where the tester identfyes the erros based on his experience.Its also known as experience based testing.
    For Example Divide by zero
