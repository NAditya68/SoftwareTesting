TECHNIQUES USED FOR BLACK BOX TESTING  

BLACKBOX TESTING- It is a testing process in which the tester who performs the testing is not aware of the coding or internal structure.

Diffrent techniques used are

1)BOUNDARY VALUE ANALYSIS-In this method the boundary values of a system are targetted.For example lets us say  a field accepts a value from 1-10.Then we give values 0,1,2, and 9,10,11 to check the behaviour.
This technique is mainly done to check the behaviour of a system at its boundary.

2)EQUIVALNCE PARTITON TESTING:In this method ,the various input are divieded into catrgories to valid and invalid values and its mandatory that all the catorgies must shoe imilar behaviour.

3)DECISION TABLE TECHNIQUE:It is a technique where a system is tested for various combinations and their respective output is captured in a tabluar format.
For Example:consider we need to uplaod any image in we bsite.it will ask for lets say a jpeg format and max size as 100kb.
